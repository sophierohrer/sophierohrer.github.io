    <h1>Why Cooking?</h1>
    <img src="images/cookedfood.jpg" alt="A bowl of a home cooked meal.">
    <p>Many people today choose to not cook because they simply do not know how. This ultimately leads to so much money being spent on fast food which isn't 
      exactly the healthiest for you or your wallet. I am very passionate about cooking and want to help as many individuals as possible to learn. I started 
      teaching myself how to cook once I moved out for college and it has been something I really enjoy doing in my freetime. I have have various recipes I 
      have tried and perfected and would love to share with others.
    
    With my storefront, I plan to provide services to teach others how to cook with included measurements, ingredients needed, and step by step videos. I believe
      this will provide a way to save people money, try new recipes, and hopefully find a new hobby! This will include recipes on the stove, oven, crockpot, and even
      airfryer! It will also cover the basics of kitchen safety, and basic skills to have. I truly want everyone to love the art of cooking as much as I do and be
      able to experiment and find something new to enjoy doing.</p>

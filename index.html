    <h1>Welcome to My Digital Headquarters!</h1>
    <p>Why is the web today's Main Street? After reading chapter one, we've come to the conclusion that the internet is a whole network of addresses.
      You can think of it like a street of houses where each website is a different house with a different address. Each website is unique like a house
      where no two are the same. The web allows us to take marketing and business to a whole new level, allowing it easier to order throughthe click of a button. 
      The web is today's "New Main Street" because it is like a road for all these "houses." Throughout even recent years, this "street" has grown majorly with websites such as Amazon,
      streaming services, and small businesses being added, and growing temendously.</p>
